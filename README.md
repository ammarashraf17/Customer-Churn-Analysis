This project aims to understand why customers stop using our service and how we can keep them longer. By looking at customer data, I find patterns in who is leaving and why â€” such as high monthly charges, short contracts, or low service usage. I also study the differences between customers who stay and those who leave. Using clear and interactive dashboards, I show these patterns and explain the main causes of churn. Based on the data, I suggest practical ways to improve retention, like offering better plans or giving extra support to customers at risk of leaving. This helps the business make better decisions and keep more loyal customers.
